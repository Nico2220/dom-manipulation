        "AlgoExpert was my go-to course to ace those coding interviews. I really liked the depth of explanation in the video tutorials and the user-friendly interface. I guess AlgoExpert and a lot of hard work makes everything possible (journey from pre-sales to development)!",

        "I would just like to point out that AlgoExpert helped me a lot to get an offer from Amazon - UK office (I accepted it). I think that AlgoExpert has everything you need in one place. It covers all important topics. I especially like the possibility to see hints in order to get an idea for the solution or to check the whole video explanation if necessary (which is very well explained!). You can literally prepare the whole coding part of the interview without changing the web browser tab.",

I went through the questions at least 5 times before my interview. Now I am working at Google as a SWE. I honestly couldn't have gotten the offer without this product.",

I was going through different sites and applications to help in my study of algorithms and data structures, but nothing was as thorough and clear as AlgoExpert. I am now starting as a Site Reliability Engineer II at Microsoft, thanks to this site!",

        "AlgoExpert helped me build a very solid foundation to tackle most of the common problems you can encounter during the interview. The most valuable feature, by far, is the video walkthroughs for each problem which makes you understand how to approach the problem. If you want to build/improve your toolset for solving problems, AlgoExpert is worth every penny. Well done.",

        "There are many platforms I tried out, but nothing taught me the problem solving skillset. They just directly jump into the solution without the why and the how. AlgoExpert has helped me transition from a service based company to a FANG company. Loads of love for the platform and of course to Clement as well.",

        "When I got the opportunity to interview at Google, I wasn't sure my skills were up to the task. The problems here really helped me brush up on some topics I hadn't covered for a long time during my time in the industry, and really gave me the confidence to go into my interviews knowing that I'd be able to give them my best. Thanks to AlgoExpert, I was able to get an offer with a significant salary increase from my last position!",

        "I used AlgoExpert to prepare for my coding interviews, and even though I was no where close to finishing all the problems, I had gained so much knowledge from the little that I did learn. With that alone it gave me more confidence to go into my interviews, and be able to problem solve on the spot without memorization, and now I'm doing great work at IBM working on a product that gets used by hundreds of millions daily. AlgoExpert is great for learning how to approach and solve problems, not just to memorize solutions. Thanks to all that work on this product.",

        "Thank you AlgoExpert team! After using the product I was able to perform well with confidence at multiple FANG on-sites and secure an offer at a hot startup. No joke, every question I got was a variation of something on the platform. Both Algo and System Design Expert gave me the tools needed to ace the interviews! Also, a shoutout to the behavior section. Super helpful, especially when applying to a smaller company where culture fit is so important. The AlgoExpert platform will be my go to for all future interviews. Cheers!",
